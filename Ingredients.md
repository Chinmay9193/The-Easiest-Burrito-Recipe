Ingredients

1 lb. lean ground beef
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1 ½ cups refried beans (or 1 ½ cups drained and rinsed black beans)
¾ cup corn kernels
3 cups cooked rice (I like to use Uncle Ben's microwaveable Ready Rice for a quick option)

1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese
Optional garnish: finely diced red onion; lettuce; diced tomato or salsa; sour cream; fresh cilantro; avocado or guacamole
